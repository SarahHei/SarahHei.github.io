            I have degrees in Anthropology and Education and currently enjoy working as a educational consultant and program evaluator.  My focus is on early childhood policy and programs, and I have worked with counties and states across the country.
            I currently am working to advance my skills in web-application design and development--I am interesting in making policy and program development more transparent and accessible.

        <p>When I'm not working, I enjoy spending time with my family, which includes seven nieces and nephews and my dog Seamus. I love travel and I am always planning my next trip.  I also try to make time for my favorite sports: Muay Thai and Mixed Martial Arts.</p>
